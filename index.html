           <b>What is A Pilot?</b> 
          </h3>
          <p>
            A pilot is a person who operates the flying controls of an aircraft.

          <h3>
           <b>What Does it Mean to Be a Pilot?</b> 
          </h3>
          <p>
            When you think of a pilot, all the cliché images that flash across your brain do have some basis for truth; 
            the suave, smiling pilot with twinkling eyes behind a pair of Ray Ban sunglasses is a predominant image, 
            but there is actually a lot going on behind those sunglasses. “Pilot” is one of those rare words 
            that is both a noun and a verb, which is fitting because a pilot is also two things at once; 
            a person who has also become a pilot. Once you become a pilot, you will never be that person you were before. 
            It is two separate people. With the giant caveat that there are always exceptions to the rule, the question is; 
            what traits do pilots have that make them a “pilot”?

          <h3>
            <b>What do you get from being A Pilot?</b>
          </h3>
          <p>
            Becoming a pilot makes you smarter. 
            You'll gain knowledge that you never thought you would need to know. 
            You'll become a better planner, a logical decision-maker, and a meteorologist. 
            You'll learn good resource management, how to be patient and how to operate safely, 
            with a sense of urgency.

            <b>Is It Worth It?</b>
          </h3>
          <p>
            Becoming an airline Pilot is a highly rewarding job and career and I can say this with confidence,
            you will not just enjoy the perks and money that comes with it, but the job itself will bring 
            its own adventures and challenges.</br>
